Untitled Phil Game
==================

STORY

You are Philip Adams (portrayed by the OSFirstTimer penguin).  You awake to find yourself in a lucid dream - you're in the Phase.  After performing a reality check, you hear a loud noise coming from your hallway.  It's coming toward you.  It's Victor Tran.  He's not just a blue happy face, he has arms, legs, and a pew pew gun.  He wants to capture you in the Phase and torment you for the rest of eternity.  You must platform youe way to defeating Victor Tran and escaping the Phase before it's too late!

CHARACTER ABILITIES

1. Walk+Run

  Phil can walk and run on dry land.  Running is performed by holding down the Shift key when moving to either the left or right.

2. Jumping

   When on dry land, Phil can jump to reach higher platforms.  If he gets a running start, he can get more air time to clear moderately large gaps.  If he needs to, he can shift his velocity in mid-air to adjust where he'll land.

3. Gliding

   Take off and fly, young Philip! With a running start and his flappy penguin wings, Phil can jump and glide to clear really large gaps.  He can't shift his velocity during a glide, so he needs to use this ability carefully and with a certain amount of skill.

4. Swimming

   Phil's penguin anatomy doesn't just provide him with the ability to glide.  If he needs to swim across a body of water, his wings turn into flippers and the Jump action allows him to swim upwards or jump out of the water onto dry land.  While swimming, he cannot initiate a Glide, crouch, or run across the ocean floor.  Using his swimming ability, Philip can also ascend up waterfalls to reach platforms.

5. Parkour: Wall-jumping

   Unlocked part-way through the game, Phil can latch onto certain walls to jump off of the wall toward a platform or another wall.  Chaining wall-jumps in quick succession will allow Philip to climb large vertical corridors with ease.
